# Rating-Prediction-System
A Rating Prediction System is a type of recommendation system that predicts the rating a user might give to an item (e.g., a movie, product, or service). It uses Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to analyze historical user-item interactions and predict future ratings. This is commonly used in platforms like Netflix, Amazon, or IMDb to personalize recommendations.

Key Steps in Building a Rating Prediction System:
Data Collection:

Gather user-item interaction data (e.g., user IDs, item IDs, and ratings).

Example: MovieLens or Amazon Review datasets.

Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values, normalize data, and split into training and testing sets.

Libraries: pandas, numpy.

Feature Engineering:

Extract useful features like user preferences, item characteristics, or contextual information.

Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas.

Model Selection:

Choose an ML algorithm to predict ratings. Common algorithms include:

Collaborative Filtering: User-Item interactions (e.g., Matrix Factorization).

Content-Based Filtering: Item features (e.g., TF-IDF, embeddings).

Hybrid Models: Combine collaborative and content-based approaches.

Deep Learning: Neural networks for complex patterns.

Libraries: scikit-learn, surprise, tensorflow, keras, pytorch.

Model Training:

Train the model on the training dataset.

Libraries: scikit-learn, surprise, tensorflow.

Evaluation:

Evaluate the model using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), or R-squared.

Libraries: scikit-learn.

Deployment:

Deploy the model to predict ratings for new user-item pairs.

Libraries: flask, fastapi.

Example Python Libraries:
pandas: Data manipulation and preprocessing.

numpy: Numerical computations.

scikit-learn: General ML algorithms and evaluation metrics.

surprise: Specifically designed for building recommendation systems.

tensorflow/keras: For deep learning-based recommendation models.

flask/fastapi: For deploying the model as an API.
